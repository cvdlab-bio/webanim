# BioPlasm: Storyboard Manager & Movie Generator

## Introduction

This is the Storyboard Manager & Movie Generator for the BioPlasm platform. It lets you design your 3D animation by drawing a directed acylcic graph (called Storyboard) that represents the precedence relationships between the logical pieces of your animation (called Segments). By choosing a 3D model for each actor on your 3D scene, and defining a behaviour for each segment, you can then get your animation rendered and save it as a movie.

## Structure
The project has been divided in three large parts: Storyboard, Rendering and Video Recording.
